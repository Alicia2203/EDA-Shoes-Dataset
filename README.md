# Price Difference Between Men’s and Women’s Shoes
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on shoes dataset

## Abstract 

Shoes are important for all genders; however, shoe brands and shoe prices vary according to gender. The purpose of this report is to explore and discover the popularity of shoe brands according to gender, and to uncover the price differences of shoe brands against gender. The men’s and women’s shoe prices dataset from Datafiniti’s Product Database was used to undergo data exploration. With the problem statements in hand, only a few meaningful variables are kept to undergo further analysis. Furthermore, inconsistent, irrelevant, and duplicated data are treated to increase the accuracy of the results. Next, R Studio is used to generate the results to the problem statements in tables and figures for a better understanding and visualisation. The validated dataset is imported to R Studio, and further adjustments had been made such as merging WomenShoes and MenShoes datasets, creating new variables, and changing the data type. The results generated shows that among the popular brands for both genders, men’s shoes take up a larger portion among the Top 20 Popular Shoe Brands, and the median price for men’s shoes are higher than women’s shoes.   

## Introduction
In this assignment, two large sample datasets namely women’s shoe prices and men’s shoe prices from Datafiniti’s Product Database were explored for critical analysis. As a basic overview, each dataset contains information regarding shoe name, brand, price, product description, manufacturer, and other attributes of product. SAS and R programming language is used for the analysis of these datasets.  

## Problem Statement
In both datasets, the popularity of the shoe brands and the price of the shoes against gender are crucial. Hence, the first problem statement is –Which gender has more products listed among popular brands? With this problem statement, the product listings for men’s and women’s shoes among popular brands will be displayed, giving the insight on whether popular brands are leaning towards a gender. The second problem statement is – What is the difference between men’s and women’s shoe prices. With this, the difference in men’s median shoe price and women’s median shoe price will give an insight on which gender has a higher shoe price on average.
